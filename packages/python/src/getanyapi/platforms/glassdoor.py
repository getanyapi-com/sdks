If no source is that fast the request is still served, by whichever source offers the best speed for its price - it is never refused for being slow. Sources we have not timed are tried last. This is a preference, not a guarantee: the median describes past requests and is not a ceiling on this one, and it excludes any wait this request itself asks for.
