If no source is that fast the request is still served, by whichever source offers the best speed for its price - it is never refused for being slow. Sources we have not timed are tried last. This is a preference, not a guarantee: the median describes past requests and is not a ceiling on this one, and it excludes any wait this request itself asks for.

Fields you do not name are still returned whenever the serving source has them. This can raise your price: when the cheapest source cannot return a named field, a dearer source serves, and you are quoted and charged its price. A named field can still be absent on a review that genuinely lacks it. Naming a combination that no single source returns together is refused as invalid input, with no charge."""
