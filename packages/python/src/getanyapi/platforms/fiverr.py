This can raise your price: when the cheapest source misses the target, a faster and dearer one serves, and you are quoted and charged its price. If no source is that fast the request is still served, by whichever source offers the best speed for its price - it is never refused for being slow. Sources we have not timed are tried last. This is a preference, not a guarantee: the median describes past requests and is not a ceiling on this one, and it excludes any wait this request itself asks for.

A single source with `allowFallbacks` false is served only by that source at its price, quoted and charged exactly, with no failover. The price is that of the dearest source that may serve. An id that does not serve this endpoint is rejected as invalid input with no charge; a listed source that is not serving right now is refused with no charge, so omit `source` to be served by another.
